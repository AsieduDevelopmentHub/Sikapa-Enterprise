          <strong>Pending</strong> — awaiting payment confirmation.

        <li>
          <strong>Confirmed</strong> — payment received and order queued for packing.

          <strong>Packed</strong> — ready for courier pickup or collection.

          <strong>Shipped</strong> — handed to the courier.

          <strong>Out for delivery</strong> — rider is on the way to your address.

      <h2>Where is my order?</h2>
      <p>
        Open <strong>My orders</strong> from the bottom nav. Each order shows the current status, the timeline of what
        has happened, and the courier assigned when available.
      </p>
      <h2>Changing an order</h2>
      <p>
        Contact support within 1 hour of placing the order if you need to change the delivery address or remove an item.
        Once the order is packed, changes are no longer possible — we&apos;d have to cancel and re-create it.
