      <h2>Is it safe?</h2>
      <p>
        Sikapa never sees or stores your card details. Paystack is PCI-DSS Level 1 certified. Every checkout session is
        encrypted end-to-end and protected with 3-D Secure where applicable.

      <h2>Receipts & invoices</h2>

        A receipt email is sent the moment payment is confirmed. You can also download an official PDF invoice from your
        order details page.

      <h2>Failed payments</h2>
      <p>
        If a payment fails, your order remains open with the status <em>pending</em>. Open it from <strong>My orders</strong>{" "}
        and tap <strong>Pay now</strong> to try again with the same or a different payment channel.
