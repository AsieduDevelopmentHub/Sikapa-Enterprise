              We aim to describe products, images, and prices accurately. Minor variations in colour or appearance may
              occur (for example due to screen settings). If an item is unavailable after you order, we will notify you

              unavailable item, consistent with our processes at the time.

                Displaying a product does not guarantee it is in stock. An order is an offer to purchase; we may accept

              Delivery or pickup options, timelines, and fees are communicated at checkout or in your order confirmation.
              Risk of loss for physical goods passes to you when the carrier records delivery or when you collect the
              order, according to the method you selected. If a shipment is delayed or lost, contact us promptly so we can
              help trace it with the carrier.

              the original payment where practicable.
